"""add sn_answer_transcripts

One transcription (and English translation) draft per recorded voice answer. Advisory
only: nothing here is merged into an artifact by the API — a human confirms the draft in
the SPA first (PRD v2 §1.1, §12).

The rows double as the async job's state, which is why there is no job table: `pending` is
work to do, `ready` is work never to pay for twice, `failed` carries its own reason and
blocks nothing. No `running` value ships: a claimed-but-unfinished state outlives a crashed
worker as a row nothing will ever move again.

The key is the answer's and the foreign key is composite ON DELETE CASCADE, so deleting or
re-recording an answer takes its draft with it — the draft is a suggestion about a
recording, and it must not outlive the recording it describes.

Creates only the sn_* table and its enum type. This database is shared with every other
Tripod app, so nothing here alters or drops anything it did not create.
