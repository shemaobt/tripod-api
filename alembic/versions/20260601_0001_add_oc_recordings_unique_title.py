"""add partial unique index on oc_recordings (project_id, title)

Revision ID: 20260601_0001
Revises: 20260519_0001
Create Date: 2026-06-01 00:00:00.000000

Enforces per-project title uniqueness for user-created recordings (ENG-71),
matching the service-layer check in recording_service. Split-derived rows
(split_from_id IS NOT NULL) and archived split parents
(splitting_status = 'archived_after_split') are exempt; NULL titles may repeat
(Postgres treats NULLs as distinct in a unique index).

PRE-DEPLOY AUDIT: run this first — it must return zero rows, or creating the
index will fail. The previous silent dedup prevented exact duplicates, so only
whitespace/case variants can exist:

    SELECT project_id, btrim(title) AS norm, count(*), array_agg(id)
    FROM oc_recordings
    WHERE title IS NOT NULL AND btrim(title) <> ''
      AND split_from_id IS NULL
      AND splitting_status <> 'archived_after_split'
    GROUP BY project_id, btrim(title)
    HAVING count(*) > 1;
