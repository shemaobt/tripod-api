"""add sn_audit_events

Who reached whose voice, and when (§12) — until now this existed only as structlog lines
that nothing could query. The events are written by the services that do the reaching, in
the same transaction, so there is never a signed URL issued without a row to say so.

Append-only by nature: nothing updates a row here, because an event is a thing that
happened. Both foreign keys to identity are SET NULL rather than CASCADE — deleting a user
must not erase the record of what that account reached, which is the one question this
table exists to answer and is asked most exactly when the account is gone.

Creates only the sn_* table and its enum type. This database is shared with every other
Tripod app, so nothing here alters or drops anything it did not create.
