"""backfill project_phases so every phase belongs to every project

Phases became a platform-owned catalog that is global to all projects: every
(project, phase) pair must have exactly one project_phases row carrying the
status. This inserts the rows missing from the cross-product with the default
status, leaving statuses already set untouched.

downgrade is a no-op: the backfilled rows are valid under the previous model
(where the pairing was an explicit per-project attachment), so dropping them
would destroy attachments a user may have made on purpose.
