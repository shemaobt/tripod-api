"""Consent records: the queryable evidence of a lawful basis (§12 / O6).

The record is the authoritative evidence; ``sn_sessions.pipeline_consent`` is a
write-only leftover the SPA sends on create and never reads back. These tests are written
against what makes the record evidence rather than decoration: that it exists for the path
the SPA actually uses, that a re-confirmation is honest about when it happened, that
nothing asserts a consent nobody gave, and that it outlives the operator who typed it.
