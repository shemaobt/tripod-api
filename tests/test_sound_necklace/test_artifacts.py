"""Artifact custody: bytes in, the same bytes out, forever.

The three artifacts are produced client-side and re-read by a downstream pipeline that
diffs them byte for byte against a golden reference (PRD §10.5). The API is only their
custodian. That makes one property load-bearing above all others: **nothing here may
parse a payload.** A `json.loads` + `json.dumps` round-trip is invisible to a shallow
assertion and fatal to the contract — it silently reorders keys, collapses whitespace,
re-escapes unicode and appends a newline.

So the payloads in these tests are deliberately ugly: keys out of alphabetical order,
two-space indents, a long float, en/em dashes, accented characters, no trailing newline.
A server that re-serialized any of them would still return valid, plausible JSON — and
every one of these tests would fail.
