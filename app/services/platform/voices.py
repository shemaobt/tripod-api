"""Language -> platform voice map.

Inline in code on purpose (owner's call): the voice is a product choice, made by ear, not
environment configuration — whoever changes it needs to hear the result and open a PR.

**One NATIVE voice per language**, not a single multilingual one. ElevenLabs warns that a
voice "retains its unique characteristics *and accent*" in any language it speaks: the single
voice (`EXAVITQu4vr4xnSDxMaL`, the one project_health and translation_helper use today) reads
English with a Brazilian accent, and vice versa. In a tool whose whole thesis is sounding
human, that matters.
