"""Platform speech-to-text (ElevenLabs Scribe), shared across apps.

Audio + the language it was spoken in -> text. Server-side only: the provider key is the
same account as `platform/tts.py` and must never reach a browser.

No cache, unlike the TTS service — and that asymmetry is the point. A synthesized question
is the same bytes for every session forever, so caching it is free money; a recorded answer
is unique by construction, so a content-addressed cache would be an object store of
single-use entries. Re-transcription is instead kept off by the caller, which persists the
draft (`sn_answer_transcripts`) and only asks again on `force`.

> Two other ElevenLabs STT clients already exist (`translation_helper/transcribe_audio.py`
> and `project_health/voice/`), each with its own copy of the multipart call. Migrating them
> here is a follow-up, exactly as it is for TTS — known debt, not an oversight.
