    """Record a consent as evidence of a lawful basis (§12), or re-confirm one.

    Idempotent per (session, type): a second confirmation updates the record rather
    than stacking another one, and names whoever confirmed it this time. Note what that
    means, because it is the record's one weakness: re-confirming REPLACES the previous
    attester and timestamp. The key is idempotent, the value is not.

    ``confirmed_at`` is assigned here rather than left to ``onupdate=func.now()``. A
    re-confirmation of an unchanged record changes no other column, and the ORM emits
    no UPDATE at all when nothing is dirty — the timestamp would silently stay at the
    first confirmation. The one thing this record must never get wrong is when it was
    confirmed.

    It commits, and that is not a free choice: routers in this repo may not, so the
    explicit ``POST /consent`` route needs the write persisted here — every other
    write-service in the module commits for the same reason. Called mid-transaction from
    ``create_session`` the same commit closes that transaction too, so the session, its
    state row and the consent land together.
