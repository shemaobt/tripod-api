    The sha256 in the path is what makes a re-upload safe. A stable key (one per

    overwrites would leave the bucket holding a triple that never coexisted while the
    database still described the old one. A content-addressed key never overwrites: a
    new upload writes a new object, the database pointer is what says which one is
    current, and a failed upload leaves an orphan nothing references rather than a
    corrupted current version.

    The frozen filename (PRD §10) is the last segment: a browser following the download
    redirect derives the saved name from the URL path, so the pipeline gets the name it
    expects without the API setting a header on bytes it never serves. The story slug is
    deliberately NOT in the key — it is user-controlled, and a slug like ``../..`` or one
    with a newline produces an object name that signs but 404s on fetch, a silent
    custody failure. The pretty download name, if ever wanted, belongs in the signed
    URL's response-disposition, not the object name.
