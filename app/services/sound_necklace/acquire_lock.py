    Acquire and renew are one statement — the WHERE decides which happened. It matches
    while the session is unheld, while the lease has lapsed, or while the caller
    already holds it, which is what makes the client's heartbeat idempotent.

    Losing is not an error: the SPA opens in review mode off the returned holder, and
    its adapter treats a throw here as a dead session rather than a busy one.

    The guarded UPDATE is the entire mutual exclusion, and the new expiry comes back
    from the statement itself. Reading it afterwards would be a different question than
    the one the write answered — on a contended row the SELECT can return the winner's
    lease to the loser, which is how a loser convinces itself it won.
