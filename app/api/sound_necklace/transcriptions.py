"""Transcription drafts for the recorded answers (ENG-325).

Two routes: one that starts the job and one the SPA polls. Both answer the same body, so
the trigger's reply is already the first frame of progress.

The work is async because it is slow and because the provider key must stay server-side.
It is triggered when the report opens rather than when an answer is uploaded: a take that
gets re-recorded first is then never paid for.
