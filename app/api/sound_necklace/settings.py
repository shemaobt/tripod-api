"""The project's bead granularity — one decision, one grid.

``beadSec`` defines the bead grid and is mixed into ``manifest_id``, so it is the
coordinate system the downstream pipeline and the training data are built on. It used to
be picked per session on the SPA's setup screen, which let two audios of one project land
on two incompatible grids. It is a property of the project, so it is decided here, once.

Reading is any sound-necklace role with access to the project — every screen that cuts
needs to know the grid. Deciding is ``project_admin``: it is a choice about the whole
corpus, not about the session in front of you.
