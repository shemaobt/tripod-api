"""Consent records — the queryable evidence of a lawful basis (§12 / O6).

The record is the authority. ``sn_sessions.pipeline_consent`` is write-only: no response
carries it and the SPA reads its own copy out of the state document, so nothing here
reads it back — ``record_consent`` only keeps it from contradicting the record.

Two routes, and neither takes the client's word for anything but WHICH consent: the
confirmer is the authenticated caller and the timestamp is the server's.

Not fenced by the editor lock. Not because a re-confirmation is harmless — it replaces
the previous attester, which is a real loss under a mutable record — but because
attesting a consent is not editing the session's work, which is what the lease exists to
serialize. A facilitator in review mode can still testify to what a speaker agreed to.
