"""Sound-necklace session tables.

A session is a facilitator's pass over one recorded story. It carries the grid
parameters the SPA needs to reopen the audio, its lifecycle status, and — in a
dedicated narrow table — the state document the SPA autosaves.

The enums live here, not with the DTOs that expose them: the database constrains
each to exactly these values, so a value change has to arrive with a migration.
Portuguese survives only inside the state document, which is the SPA's and is
never interpreted here.

    column with no bound at all and would overflow anything declared here; an artifact's
    storage key is content-addressed, so it changes under a re-upload and a stale key would
    read as a different file; and the logical ref is what a person auditing this actually
    recognises. (session_id, resource_ref) is the resource's identity, exactly as its own

    its allowlist bounds at 93 — and 128 is a measured number: a Terena pilot slug once

    the proxy's address, and the client end of ``X-Forwarded-For`` is appended to whatever
    the caller sent, so it is forgeable. Both would put a number in an evidence log that
