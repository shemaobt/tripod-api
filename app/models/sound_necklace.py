"""Pydantic schemas for the sound-necklace app module.

The wire contract the SPA generates its TypeScript types from (code-first
OpenAPI). Provisional: the resources not yet implemented are stubs returning 501, so
every schema is tagged ``x-stability: experimental`` and mirrors the SPA's provisional
contracts (sound-necklace ``contracts/``). Artifacts and the session-state envelope are
opaque — never parsed or re-serialized here.

Where this and the SPA's provisional contracts disagree, this wins and the SPA
regenerates: its ``contracts/bucket.ts`` still types the codebook version as an integer
and the audio duration as non-null, and both are wrong against the pipeline that
actually mints them (ENG-261).
